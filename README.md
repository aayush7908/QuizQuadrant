# QuizQuadrant

## Description
QuizQuadrant is a web application that aims for providing online examination environment. This App has two type of users: **1. Students** and **2. Teachers**

Teachers can create new questions related to specific subject and subtopic, which can be published publically which can help students in their preparations. Teachers can also create examinations and select the allowed candidates.

Students can see all ongoing exams in their dashboard. Apart from that, they can also see all previously conducted exams and exams scheduled for future.

Once the examination is over, teacher can generate results with the help of application, which then published. Once the results are published, students can check leaderboard.
